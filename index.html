   <h1>How to Meditate</h1>
   <p class="intro">Why do we meditate? We meditate to find, to recover, to come back to something of ourselves we once dimly and unknowingly had and have lost without knowing what it was or where or when we lost it.</p> 
   <h2>The Psychological Effect of Meditation</h2>
   <p>In all good psychotheraphy and in all good meditation, there is a therapeutic factor which is rarelt mentioned. It is the careful paying attention to ourselves, to <em>all</em> of ourself including those parts we have characterized as "best" and "worse". In this orientation we train ourselves to regard ourselves seriously and to be concerned with our total being, involving not only our bestpossible relationship with ourselves, but also our best possible relationship with other, which we begin to realize is a deep need of ours and a need that is a part of total being. In learning to take ourselves seroiusly we begin to learn how to important it is that we garden and cultivate that being and, therefore, by neccessity, the being of other.(Page 40)</p> 
   <h2>The Basic Types of Meditation</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>The Path Through the Intellect</li>
     <li>The Path of Emotions</li>
     <li>The Rout of Body</li>
     <li>The Path of Actions</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>The "How" of Meditation</h2>
   <p>What is the facts? How do we feel about them? None of these meditation are "easy" and "gentle" ones. They hold the possibility of shaking you up more than you expect. They must be done with persistence and courage, cougrate to face the unexpected in you and to look at it and attempt to let yourself comprehennd it.(Page 115)</p>
